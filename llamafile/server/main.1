.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl m Ar model.gguf
.Op flags...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a brand new HTTP server for Large Language Models (LLMs). To date,
its development has been focused on doing fewer things really well, and
right now that's serving embeddings. It offers you 3.4x the performance,
stronger security, client request prioritization, request preemption, as
well as request isolation that helps ensure software bugs won't cause
the whole server to crash.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl Fl version
Print version and exit.
.It Fl h , Fl Fl help
Show help message and exit.
.It Fl m Ar FNAME , Fl Fl model Ar FNAME
Path of GGUF model weights. Each server process is currently limited to
serving only one model. If you need to host multiple models, then it's
recommended that you run multiple instances of llamafiler behind a
reverse proxy such as NGINX or Redbean.
.It Fl l Ar HOSTPORT , Fl Fl listen Ar HOSTPORT
Specifies the local [HOST:]PORT on which the HTTP server should listen.
By default this is 0.0.0.0:8080 which means llamafiler will bind to port
8080 on every locally available IPv4 network interface. This option may
currently only be specified once.
.It Fl Fl url-prefix Ar URLPREFIX
Specifies a URL prefix (subdirectory) under which the HTTP server will
make the API accessible, e.g. /lamafiler. Useful when running llamafiler
behind a reverse proxy such as NGINX or Redbean. By default, this is set
to / (root).
.It Fl w Ar N , Fl Fl workers Ar N
Number of HTTP client handling threads.
.It Fl Fl trust Ar CIDR
Adds a network to the trusted network list. This argument is specified
in the form IPV4/MASKBITS, e.g. 192.168.0.0/24. By default, all clients
are untrusted, which means they're subject to token bucket throttling,
and additional security precautions that may cause request handling to
go slightly slower. Therefore this flag is important to use if you want
to accurately benchmark llamafiler, since the server will otherwise see
the benchmark as a DDOS and deprioritize its traffic accordingly.
.It Fl Fl ip-header Ar STR
If this flag is passed a value, e.g. X-Forwarded-For, then any trusted
may send this header to your llamafile server to let it know what the
true effective client IPv4 address actually is. After this happens the
default security restrictions, e.g. token bucket, will be measured and
applied against that IPv4 address and its adjacent networks.
.It Fl Fl token-rate Ar N
Specifies how many times per second a token is dropped in each bucket.
This setting is used to define a limitation on how many TCP connects and
HTTP messages each chunk of the IPv4 address space is permitted to send
to llamafiler over a sustained period of time. The default token rate is
1, which means that, on a long enough timeline, a class-C network will
be deprioritized if it sends more than one request per second. No real
penalty actually applies though until the server runs out of resources,
e.g. HTTP request workers.
.It Fl Fl token-burst Ar N
Specifies how many HTTP requests and TCP connects a given slice of the
IPv4 address space is permitted to send within a short period of time,
before token bucket restrictions kick in, and cause the client to be
deprioritized. By default, this value is set to 100. It may be tuned to
any value between 1 and 127 inclusive.
.It Fl Fl token-cidr Ar N
Specifies IPv4 address space granularity of token bucket algorithm, in
network bits. By default, this value is set to 24 which means individual
IPv4 addresses are viewed as being representative members of a class-C
network, or in other words, each group of 256 IPv4 addresses is lumped
together. If one IP in the group does something bad, then bad things
happen to all the other IPv4 addresses in that granule. This number may
be set to any integer between 3 and 32 inclusive. Specifying a higher
number will trade away system memory to increase network specificity.
For example, using 32 means that 4 billion individual token buckets will
be created. By default, a background thread drops one token in each
bucket every second, so that could potentially be a lot of busy work. A
value of three means that everyone on the Internet who talks to your
server will have to fight over only eight token buckets in total.
.It Fl Fl unsecure
Disables sandboxing. By default, llamafiler puts itself in a SECCOMP BPF
sandbox, so that even if your server gets hacked in the worst possible
way (some kind of C++ memory bug) then there's very little damage an
attacker will be able to do. This works by restricting system calls
using Cosmopolitan Libc's implementation of pledge() which is currently
only supported on Linux (other OSes will simply be unsecured by
default). The pledge security policy that's used by default is "stdio
anet" which means that only relatively harmless system calls like
read(), write(), and accept() are allowed once the server has finished
initializing. It's not possible for remotely executed code to do things
like launch subprocesses, read or write to the filesystem, or initiate a
new connection to a server.
.It Fl k Ar N , Fl Fl keepalive Ar N
Specifies the TCP keepalive interval in seconds. This value is passed
along to both TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL if they're supported by the
host operating system. If this value is greater than 0, then the the
SO_KEEPALIVE and TCP_NODELAY options are enabled on network sockets, if
supported by the host operating system. The default keepalive is 5.
.It Fl Fl http-obuf-size Ar N
Size of HTTP output buffer size, in bytes. Default is 1048576.
.It Fl Fl http-ibuf-size Ar N
Size of HTTP input buffer size, in bytes. Default is 1048576.
.Sh EXAMPLE
Here's an example of how you might start this server:

.Dl "llamafiler -m all-MiniLM-L6-v2.F32.gguf"
.Pp
Here's how to send a tokenization request:
.Pp
.Dl "curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8080/tokenize?prompt=hello+world"
.Pp
Here's how to send a embedding request:
.Pp
.Dl "curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8080/embedding?content=hello+world"
