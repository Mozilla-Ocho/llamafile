[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mllamafile-quantize [22mconverts  large  language  model  weights  from  the
       float32  or float16 formats into smaller data types from 2 to 8 bits in
       size.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The following flags are available:

       [1m--allow-requantize[0m
               Allows requantizing tensors that have already  been  quantized.
               Warning:  This can severely reduce quality compared to quantiz‚Äê
               ing from 16bit or 32bit

       [1m--leave-output-tensor[0m
               Will leave output.weight un(re)quantized. Increases model  size
               but may also increase quality, especially when requantizing

       [1m--pure  [22mDisable  k-quant  mixtures and quantize all tensors to the same
               type

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       The following positional arguments are accepted:

       [4mmodel-f32.gguf[0m
               Is the input file, which contains the unquantized model weights
               in either the float32 or float16 format.

       [4mmodel-quant.gguf[0m
               Is the output file, which will contain quantized weights in the
               desired format. If this path isn't specified, it'll default  to
               [inp path]/ggml-model-[ftype].gguf.

       [4mtype[24m    Is the desired quantization format, which may be the integer id
               of  a supported quantization type, or its name. See the quanti‚Äê
               zation types section below for acceptable formats.

       [4mnthreads[0m
               Number of threads to use during computation (default: nproc/2)

[1mQUANTIZATION TYPES[0m
       The following quantization types are available. This table shows the ID
       of the quantization format, its name, the file size of 7B model weights
       that use it, and finally the amount of quality badness it introduces as
       measured by the llamafile-perplexity tool averaged over 128 chunks with
       the TinyLLaMA 1.1B v1.0 Chat model. Rows are ordered in accordance with
       how recommended the quantization format is for general usage.
