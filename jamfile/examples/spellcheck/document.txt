The first spell ceckers were "verifiers" instead of "correctors." They
offered no suggestions for incorrectly spelled words. This was helpful
for typos but it was not so helpfl for logical or phonetic errors. The
challenge the developers faced was the difficulty in offering useful
suggestions for misspelled words. This requires reducing words to a
sceletal form and applying pattern-matching algorithms.
